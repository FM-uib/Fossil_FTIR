# Notes
extracted fossil pollen from sediment.
ca 5 common taxa: Alnus, Picea, Pinus,

## Cores
Dalmuttlado:
- pine
- holocene

Totenmoos [@heissUltenValleySouth2005]:
- bog-sediment core; past 15000 yrs
- min 1000 grains counted
- Picea, Pinus very common, switch at 10000 BP from Pinus to Picea
- Alnus, Betula throughout
- Abies, Fagus after 9000 BP
- trace Quercus

Younger Dryas [@brauerHighResolutionSediment1999]:
- 12 samples laminated sediment
- from  11400 to 13120
- min 500 grains
- pollen conc highest in 11000-11600 and 12700-12900
- Pinus betula most common (ca 150 grains counted)
- salix (ca 25 counted)
- quercus throughout in low conc (<1%)
- graminoids/cyperaceae/artemisia common

Tiefer See:
- 1870-2010
- laminated sediments
- Pinus pollen

Tinner alpine:

Tinner meso-mediterranean:
[@bisculmHoloceneVegetationFire2012; @vanniereClimateHumandrivenFire2008]
Quercus sections Quercus, Cerris and Ilex

Tinner sub-mediterranean:

Quercus sections Quercus, Cerris and Ilex

## Time to measure notes:
- Time to measure 50 pollen grains on single taxa slides: min 60 min. 
- includes Mounting, selecting pollen, measuring time FTIR

Fossil pollen will require more searching in the selection phase.
Have to measure ~75 grains if we target 50 good spectra.
Estimate time for mounting, selecting, measuring 75 grains of one taxa: 90 - 120 min

10 days in the lab; 8+ hrs a day: 80 hrs
Target: 5 taxa per sample; 5 x 90: 7.5 hrs `r 5*90/60`

9-12 13-24
10 days in the lab; 14 hrs a day: 140
Target: 5 taxa per sample; 140/7.5 = 18; 14/10 = 14

```{r}
total_samples = function(hrs_per_sample, no_taxa, total_hrs = 140){
  tmp = total_hrs / (no_taxa * hrs_per_sample)
  return(signif(tmp,3))
}
M = outer(c(1,1.5,2),c(3,4,5),total_samples, total_hrs = 140)
row.names(M) = c(1,1.5,2)
colnames(M) = c(3,4,5)
print('Number of samples at One Core')
M
```

Anywhere from 18 to 30 samples is reasonable.
At 3 cores 5 taxa:
Minimum 4 samples per core 
Maximum 9 samples per core

```{r}
print('No. of samples at Three Cores')
signif(M/3, 3)
```
At 2 cores 5 taxa:
Minimum 7 samples per core
Maximum 14 samples per core

```{r}
print('No. of samples at Two Cores')
signif(M/2, 3)
```

# Introduction
Research Questions:
1. chemical variation between taxa in the same cores.
2. chemical variation between taxa between cores 
3. chemical variation of pollen with depths/age

# Methods and Materials
## Labwork Report

did ÂµFTIR on fresh and fossil pollen using Hyperion-FPA

This is very sample dependent.
organic rich cores are problematic (requires a better extraction protocol), pollen density is another.
Dalmutladdo was a very good core for this: low in organic and relatively rich in pollen.
BSi increased with depth, highest in oldest samples (extracted blanks).
Still, some depth were more time intensive (130/150), low amount of pollen .
I managed about 2-3 core samples per day, the fresh samples can be done in a fraction of the time, all done within 1 half day.

9 depth from Dalmutladdo core. targeted and extracted Pinus pollen (see table)

possibilities for Alnus and Betula, even though scattering visible in spectra 

```{r}
dalmutladdo = data.frame(ID = c("DAL_08","DAL_20","DAL_40","DAL_60","DAL_90", "DAL_110","DAL_130","DAL_140","DAL_150"),
                         pinus_pollen = c(23,49,37,47,36,32,39,17,7),
                         alnus_pollen = c(0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0),
                         betula_pollen = c(0,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0))

```

```{r}
fresh_pollen = data.frame(ID = c("BGO_PS7", "BGO_PS8", "INN_PS13", "INN_PS19A","NMBU_Pin_syl_14E1", "NMBU_Pin_syl_14H1", "NMBU_Aln_glu_14E1", "NMBU_Aln_glu_14J1", "NMBU_Aln_inc_14B1", "NMBU_Aln_inc_14G1", "NMBU_Bet_pub_14A1", "NMBU_Bet_pub_14B1", "NMBU_Cor_ave_14B1", "NMBU_Cor_ave_14C1"),
                          extracted = c(109,55,51,24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0))

Research questions we could answer with this set:

- Differences between fresh and fossil/near fossil grains of Pinus
- chemical changes in Pinus pollen with age/depth
(- chemical differences between Pinus/Alnus/Betula)

extensions to this set:
- add more samples from Dalmuttladdo highest and lowest depth (maybe labwork)
- add cores (e.g. MFM, Tiefer See or Italian cores), Festi core was quite organic rich
-
