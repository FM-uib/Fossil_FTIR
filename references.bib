  abstract = {This work focuses on a 1900-year section of varved sediments from Lake Meerfelder Maar (MFM) extending from the Late Aller+d to the Preboreal. Varve counting provides the chronological framework and determines the length of Younger Dryas to 1025\textemdash{}1090 years. A strong relation between climate change, environment response and depositional processes has been found. In consequence, varve microfacies variations are a sensitive proxy for environment changes. These are reflected, for example, in erosion processes within the lake's catchment (minerogenic input) and lake productivity (diatom blooms). The observed varve changes have been quantified by multiproxy analyses of physical and chemical sediment parameters with a resolution of between 8 and 40 years depending on sedimentation rate. In addition, high resolution palynological investigations provide the biostratigraphical subdivision based on changes in the vegetation occurring during the same time interval. Varve observations reveal that environment changes at the beginning and the end of the Younger Dryas occurred within 20\textemdash{}50 years. Furthermore, sediment and vegetation changes were synchronous. Within the actual precision of the MFM and GRIP chronologies (divergence of only a few decades) terrestrial responses in Western Europe occurred quasi-synchronous to temperature changes in Greenland. 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A total of 15 organic-rich sediment samples, obtained from sites in Corsica and the Southern European Alps, was treated using both dense-media separation and the conventional preparation method in order to compare the relative efficiencies of the two methods. The dense-media separation method consistently achieved a remarkably higher purity of extracted pollen grains. This was especially true for the Corsican peat samples, the dense-media separations being quite pure, whereas the classical method produced samples that were so severely polluted with organic fragments that it was impossible to carry out a satisfactory pollen analysis. The percentage values of each taxon were generally similar using both methods, showing that the two methods are compatible for pollen analytical studies. Total pollen concentrations were generally higher with the dense-media separation method (especially for gyttja samples). In conclusion, dense-media separation is an efficient method for pollen extraction from organic as well as from minerogenic sediments and deposits.},

The data suggest that after 10 000 cal a BP increasing moisture availability supported closed forests with deciduous (Quercus cerris, Fagus sylvatica and Fraxinus spp.) and evergreen (Quercus ilex) species. Species-rich closed forest persisted until 6850 cal a BP, when Neolithic activities caused a forest decline and affected plant diversity. Secondary forest with abundant Ilex aquifolium recovered between 6650 and 6000 cal a BP, indicating moist conditions. From 5000 cal a BP, agriculture and pastoralism led to the currently fragmented landscape with sparse deciduous forests (Quercus cerris). The study suggests that evergreen broadleaved species were more important at elevations above 1000 m a.s.l. before ca. 5000 cal a BP than subsequently, which might reflect less human impact or warmer-than-today climatic conditions between 10 000 and 5000 cal a BP. Despite land use since Neolithic times, deciduous supra-mediterranean forests were never completely displaced from the Nebrodi Mountains, because of favourable moist conditions that persisted throughout the Holocene. Reconstructed vegetation dynamics document the absence of any pronounced mid- or late-Holocene `aridification' trend at the site, an issue which is controversially debated in Italy and the Mediterranean region.

  abstract = {A high-resolution sedimentary charcoal record from Lago dell'Accesa in southern Tuscany reveals numerous changes in fire regime over the last 11.6kyrcal.BP and provides one of the longest gap-free series from Italy and the Mediterranean region. Charcoal analyses are coupled with gamma density measurements, organic-content analyses, and pollen counts to provide data about sedimentation and vegetation history. A comparison between fire frequency and lake-level reconstructions from the same site is used to address the centennial variability of fire regimes and its linkage to hydrological processes. Our data reveal strong relationships among climate, fire, vegetation, and land-use and attest to the paramount importance of fire in Mediterranean ecosystems. The mean fire interval (MFI) for the entire Holocene was estimated to be 150yr, with a minimum around 80yr and a maximum around 450yr. Between 11.6 and 3.6kyrcal.BP, up to eight high-frequency fire phases lasting 300\textendash{}500yr generally occurred during shifts towards low lake-level stands (ca 11,300, 10,700, 9500, 8700, 7600, 6200, 5300, 3400, 1800 and 1350cal.yrBP). Therefore, we assume that most of these shifts were triggered by drier climatic conditions and especially a dry summer season that promoted ignition and biomass burning. At the beginning of the Holocene, high climate seasonality favoured fire expansion in this region, as in many other ecosystems of the northern and southern hemispheres. Human impact affected fire regimes and especially fire frequencies since the Neolithic (ca 8000\textendash{}4000cal.yrBP). Burning as a consequence of anthropogenic activities became more frequent after the onset of the Bronze Age (ca 3800\textendash{}3600cal.yrBP) and appear to be synchronous with the development of settlements in the region, slash-and-burn agriculture, animal husbandry, and mineral exploitation. The anthropogenic phases with maximum fire activity corresponded to greater sensitivity of the vegetation and triggered significant changes in vegetational communities (e.g. temporal declines of Quercus ilex forests and expansion of shrublands and macchia). The link between fire and climate persisted during the mid- and late Holocene, when human impact on vegetation and the fire regime was high. This finding suggests that climatic conditions were important for fire occurrence even under strongly humanised ecosystem conditions.},

  abstract = {Pollen productivity is a key parameter to quantify past plant abundances and vegetation openness. In this study we explore how changes in land management influence pollen productivity. We study pollen deposition in largely annually laminated sediments from Lake Tiefer See in the Northeastern German lowlands deposited between AD 1880 and 2010. During this period, land use intensity has increased predominantly through the widespread introduction of artificial fertilizers, herbicides and heavy machinery mainly since the 1950s. Although land use statistics show that overall vegetation openness remained largely constant, non-arboreal pollen deposition (from herbs and grasses) sharply declined over the study period. This decline can be partly explained by a shift towards crops that emit little pollen such as wheat and oilseed rape. Furthermore, intensified grassland management, including drainage, also contributed to lower pollen deposition because of the decline of Plantago lanceolata and Rumex from grassland communities. However, the most important effect is a decline in pollen productivity of grasses of about 60\%, which most likely is a response to earlier and more frequent mowing, although changes in grass species composition may also have played a role. Our results show that the type and intensity of land use have a strong effect on pollen productivity of grasses (and smaller effects on further crops). Since grass pollen deposition is a main proxy for vegetation openness and grasses are the common reference taxon in most PPE studies, variations in the pollen productivity of grasses introduce so far neglected errors in the reconstruction of the past vegetation cover. Our study provides a first estimate about the magnitude of this effect.},

  abstract = {A core recovered from a thick sedimentary sequence in the Ioannina basin, on the western flank of the Pindus Mountain Range, northwest Greece, presents the opportunity to observe multiple changes in vegetational communities at one locality through a series of glacial-interglacial Quaternary cycles. The Ioannina 249 record adds to the knowledge of vegetation history of areas of increased topographical variability and precipitation of the western Balkans and provides a complete stratigraphical record that can be compared with that of other long terrestrial sequences and with the marine record. Pollen analytical results are presented as percentages and concentrations, the former providing information on the composition and structure of vegetation, while the latter is considered here to be a reliable indication of vegetation density when changes differing by an order of magnitude are documented. The record shows an hierarchical order of variation in the response of vegetation to environmental change. Higher order of magnitude changes are alternations between forest and open vegetation communities, a reflection of major climatic shifts from interglacial to glacial modes. Superimposed on these oscillations is a lower order variability associated with vegetation changes within interglacial and glacial periods. During forest periods a succession is recorded with Quercus and Ulmus/Zelkova expanding early, followed by Carpinus betulus and also Ostrya carpinifolia/Carpinus orientalis, and finally Abies often accompanied by Fagus. Although individual periods may be characterized by dominance of one or more taxa, the underlying pattern of differential expansion is usually distinct and consistent. Nine forested intervals are distinguished and are assigned local names to facilitate long-distance comparisons and correlations. During open vegetation periods a series of changes is also observed from transitional steppe-forest or forest-steppe vegetation, through grassland steppe communities, culminating in a discontinuous desert-steppe vegetation. In addition to the two ends of the spectrum (forest and desert-steppe), attention is drawn to the intermediate phases representing `average' Quaternary conditions. The Ioannina record is correlated with that of other long sequences from Europe and variation in the response of vegetation with site characteristics is considered. A strategy for long-distance correlations relying on the primary structure of vegetation and relative stratigraphical position of individual periods is described. The last interglacial period followed by two interstadials is recorded in much the same fashion in all records. Correlation of earlier periods was also in general agreement although only two continuous records that extend beyond the last interglacial are at present available for comparison. To minimize elements of circularity, similarities in the behaviour of individual taxa during particular periods are not part of the correlation criteria so that if their chronostratigraphical equivalence is independently corroborated their significance can be examined. On this basis, the importance of Carpinus betulus and the almost complete absence of Fagus on a subcontinental scale during the last interglacial are noted. Possible effects of climate, competition and disease are discussed. Cross-correlation with the deep-sea oxygen isotope record provides a tentative chronology for the Ioannina record. Based on this, the sequence down to a depth of 162.75 m is considered to represent a record of approximately the past 423 000 years. Aspects of land-sea correlations are discussed in the light of the Ioannina 249 record and the importance of long sequences in the development of European Quaternary stratigraphy is emphasized.},

Isopoll maps for selected taxa in western Eurasia and eastern North America illustrate features of these 'migrations' which can be seen on both continents despite their major geographical contrasts and the different taxa involved. These maps show differential rates and directions of migration among taxa and illustrate different behaviour among taxa that today share similar distributions and/or grow together in communities. Communities are thus shown to be merely temporary assemblages of species brought togheter by the environmental conditions prevailing at any particular time. Migration of plant taxa is considered as a response to orbitally-forced cimate changes at timescales of 105 years, and is compared to bird migration as a response to seasonal climate changes. The two phenomena are seen to be essentially similar and to have many of the same consequences, although they involve organisms that respond differently to climatic changes at different frequencies. Plant taxa have shown only limited macroevolutionary response to the climatic fluctuations of the last \$1.6 \textbackslash time 10\^6\$ years. Their migratory responses to these climate changes have, however, led to alternating allopatry and sympatry, and alson often to isolated small populations, both situations which are believed to favour rapid macroevolution.},

  abstract = {Paleoecology can provide valuable insights into the ecology of species that complement observation and experiment-based assessments of climate impact dynamics. New paleoecological records (e.g., pollen, macrofossils) from the Italian Peninsula suggest a much wider climatic niche of the important European tree species Abies alba (silver fir) than observed in its present spatial range. To explore this discrepancy between current and past distribution of the species, we analyzed climatic data (temperature, precipitation, frost, humidity, sunshine) and vegetation-independent paleoclimatic reconstructions (e.g., lake levels, chironomids) and use global coupled carbon-cycle climate (NCAR CSM1.4) and dynamic vegetation (LandClim) modeling. The combined evidence suggests that during the mid-Holocene (∼6000 years ago), prior to humanization of vegetation, A. alba formed forests under conditions that exceeded the modern (1961–1990) upper temperature limit of the species by ∼5–7°C (July means). Annual precipitation during this natural period was comparable to today ({$>$}700–800 mm), with drier summers and wetter winters. In the meso-Mediterranean to sub-Mediterranean forests A. alba co-occurred with thermophilous taxa such as Quercus ilex, Q. pubescens, Olea europaea, Phillyrea, Arbutus, Cistus, Tilia, Ulmus, Acer, Hedera helix, Ilex aquifolium, Taxus, and Vitis. Results from the last interglacial (ca. 130 000–115 000 BP), when human impact was negligible, corroborate the Holocene evidence. Thermophilous Mediterranean A. alba stands became extinct during the last 5000 years when land-use pressure and specifically excessive anthropogenic fire and browsing disturbance increased. Our results imply that the ecology of this key European tree species is not yet well understood. On the basis of the reconstructed realized climatic niche of the species, we anticipate that the future geographic range of A. alba may not contract regardless of migration success, even if climate should become significantly warmer than today with summer temperatures increasing by up to 5–7°C, as long as precipitation does not fall below 700–800 mm/yr, and anthropogenic disturbance (e.g., fire, browsing) does not become excessive. Our finding contradicts recent studies that projected range contractions under global-warming scenarios, but did not factor how millennia of human impacts reduced the realized climatic niche of A. alba.},

  abstract = {Nitraria is a halophytic taxon (i.e., adapted to saline environments) that belongs to the plant family Nitrariaceae and is distributed from the Mediterranean, across Asia into the south-eastern tip of Australia. This taxon is thought to have originated in Asia during the Paleogene (66-23 Ma), alongside the proto-Paratethys epicontinental sea. The evolutionary history of Nitraria might hold important clues on the links between climatic and biotic evolution but limited taxonomic documentation of this taxon has thus far hindered this line of research. Here we investigate if the pollen morphology and the chemical composition of the pollen wall are informative of the evolutionary history of Nitraria and could explain if origination along the proto-Paratethys and dispersal to the Tibetan Plateau was simultaneous or a secondary process. To answer these questions, we applied a novel approach consisting of a combination of Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), to determine the chemical composition of the pollen wall, and pollen morphological analyses using Light Microscopy (LM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). We analysed our data using ordinations (principal components analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling), and directly mapped it on the Nitrariaceae phylogeny to produce a phylomorphospace and a phylochemospace. Our LM, SEM and FTIR analyses show clear morphological and chemical differences between the sister groups Peganum and Nitraria. Differences in the morphological and chemical characteristics of highland species (Nitraria schoberi, N. sphaerocarpa, N. sibirica and N. tangutorum) and lowland species (Nitraria billardierei and N. retusa) are very subtle, with phylogenetic history appearing to be a more important control on Nitraria pollen than local environmental conditions. Our approach shows a compelling consistency between the chemical and morphological characteristics of the eight studied Nitrariaceae species, and these traits are in agreement with the phylogenetic tree. Taken together, this demonstrates how novel methods for studying fossil pollen can facilitate the evolutionary investigation of living and extinct taxa, and the environments they represent.},
