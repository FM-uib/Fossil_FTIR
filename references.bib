  abstract = {This work focuses on a 1900-year section of varved sediments from Lake Meerfelder Maar (MFM) extending from the Late Aller+d to the Preboreal. Varve counting provides the chronological framework and determines the length of Younger Dryas to 1025\textemdash{}1090 years. A strong relation between climate change, environment response and depositional processes has been found. In consequence, varve microfacies variations are a sensitive proxy for environment changes. These are reflected, for example, in erosion processes within the lake's catchment (minerogenic input) and lake productivity (diatom blooms). The observed varve changes have been quantified by multiproxy analyses of physical and chemical sediment parameters with a resolution of between 8 and 40 years depending on sedimentation rate. In addition, high resolution palynological investigations provide the biostratigraphical subdivision based on changes in the vegetation occurring during the same time interval. Varve observations reveal that environment changes at the beginning and the end of the Younger Dryas occurred within 20\textemdash{}50 years. Furthermore, sediment and vegetation changes were synchronous. Within the actual precision of the MFM and GRIP chronologies (divergence of only a few decades) terrestrial responses in Western Europe occurred quasi-synchronous to temperature changes in Greenland. 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {The separation of dissolved and/or undissolved materials having different densities or different buoyancy densities can be effected with the aid of agents comprising solutions of true metatungstates. In the case of a separation of materials having different buoyancy densities by means of a density gradient centrifugation, the agent has the form of an aqueous solution of an alkali, ammonium or alkaline earth metal metatungstate and, if desired, may be augmented by the addition of at least one low molecular weight electrolyte. The agent can have a density of up to 3.1 g.cm-3, has a low viscosity at high concentrations, and is neutral and chemically insert. In the case of a separation of water-insoluble solid mixtures of different densities, the densities of the solutions of the true metatungstates can be increased up to 4.6 g.cm-3 by adding to the solutions high density materials such as sodium tungstate or tungsten carbide of suitable grain size so as to form a suspension.},

  abstract = {Dense-media separation, frequently adopted as a standard pollen extraction method for use with minerogenic sediment samples, was adapted for use with organic-rich sediment and peat samples. A total of 15 organic-rich sediment samples, obtained from sites in Corsica and the Southern European Alps, was treated using both dense-media separation and the conventional preparation method in order to compare the relative efficiencies of the two methods. The dense-media separation method consistently achieved a remarkably higher purity of extracted pollen grains. This was especially true for the Corsican peat samples, the dense-media separations being quite pure, whereas the classical method produced samples that were so severely polluted with organic fragments that it was impossible to carry out a satisfactory pollen analysis. The percentage values of each taxon were generally similar using both methods, showing that the two methods are compatible for pollen analytical studies. Total pollen concentrations were generally higher with the dense-media separation method (especially for gyttja samples). In conclusion, dense-media separation is an efficient method for pollen extraction from organic as well as from minerogenic sediments and deposits.},

Density centrifugation for the separation of pollen from a gyttja sample rich in resistant organic matter was tested. Combining centrifugations in two CsCl solutions, one of higher density and one of lower density than pollen, a pure pollen fraction was successfully prepared. Data on the isodensity and sedimentation rate of `fossilized' recent pollen from twelve tree taxa are also presented, and the potential for separating a single taxon from pollen assemblages is demonstrated.},
