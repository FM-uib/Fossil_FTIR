  abstract = {This work focuses on a 1900-year section of varved sediments from Lake Meerfelder Maar (MFM) extending from the Late Aller+d to the Preboreal. Varve counting provides the chronological framework and determines the length of Younger Dryas to 1025\textemdash{}1090 years. A strong relation between climate change, environment response and depositional processes has been found. In consequence, varve microfacies variations are a sensitive proxy for environment changes. These are reflected, for example, in erosion processes within the lake's catchment (minerogenic input) and lake productivity (diatom blooms). The observed varve changes have been quantified by multiproxy analyses of physical and chemical sediment parameters with a resolution of between 8 and 40 years depending on sedimentation rate. In addition, high resolution palynological investigations provide the biostratigraphical subdivision based on changes in the vegetation occurring during the same time interval. Varve observations reveal that environment changes at the beginning and the end of the Younger Dryas occurred within 20\textemdash{}50 years. Furthermore, sediment and vegetation changes were synchronous. Within the actual precision of the MFM and GRIP chronologies (divergence of only a few decades) terrestrial responses in Western Europe occurred quasi-synchronous to temperature changes in Greenland. 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In the case of a separation of materials having different buoyancy densities by means of a density gradient centrifugation, the agent has the form of an aqueous solution of an alkali, ammonium or alkaline earth metal metatungstate and, if desired, may be augmented by the addition of at least one low molecular weight electrolyte. The agent can have a density of up to 3.1 g.cm-3, has a low viscosity at high concentrations, and is neutral and chemically insert. In the case of a separation of water-insoluble solid mixtures of different densities, the densities of the solutions of the true metatungstates can be increased up to 4.6 g.cm-3 by adding to the solutions high density materials such as sodium tungstate or tungsten carbide of suitable grain size so as to form a suspension.},

  abstract = {Dense-media separation, frequently adopted as a standard pollen extraction method for use with minerogenic sediment samples, was adapted for use with organic-rich sediment and peat samples. A total of 15 organic-rich sediment samples, obtained from sites in Corsica and the Southern European Alps, was treated using both dense-media separation and the conventional preparation method in order to compare the relative efficiencies of the two methods. The dense-media separation method consistently achieved a remarkably higher purity of extracted pollen grains. This was especially true for the Corsican peat samples, the dense-media separations being quite pure, whereas the classical method produced samples that were so severely polluted with organic fragments that it was impossible to carry out a satisfactory pollen analysis. The percentage values of each taxon were generally similar using both methods, showing that the two methods are compatible for pollen analytical studies. Total pollen concentrations were generally higher with the dense-media separation method (especially for gyttja samples). In conclusion, dense-media separation is an efficient method for pollen extraction from organic as well as from minerogenic sediments and deposits.},

  abstract = {High-resolution pollen, macrofossil and charcoal data, combined with accelerator mass spectrometry 14C dating and multivariate analysis, were used to reconstruct Holocene vegetation and fire dynamics at Urio Quattrocchi, a small lake in the supra-mediterranean belt in the Nebrodi Mountains of Sicily (Italy). The data suggest that after 10 000 cal a BP increasing moisture availability supported closed forests with deciduous (Quercus cerris, Fagus sylvatica and Fraxinus spp.) and evergreen (Quercus ilex) species. Species-rich closed forest persisted until 6850 cal a BP, when Neolithic activities caused a forest decline and affected plant diversity. Secondary forest with abundant Ilex aquifolium recovered between 6650 and 6000 cal a BP, indicating moist conditions. From 5000 cal a BP, agriculture and pastoralism led to the currently fragmented landscape with sparse deciduous forests (Quercus cerris). The study suggests that evergreen broadleaved species were more important at elevations above 1000 m a.s.l. before ca. 5000 cal a BP than subsequently, which might reflect less human impact or warmer-than-today climatic conditions between 10 000 and 5000 cal a BP. Despite land use since Neolithic times, deciduous supra-mediterranean forests were never completely displaced from the Nebrodi Mountains, because of favourable moist conditions that persisted throughout the Holocene. Reconstructed vegetation dynamics document the absence of any pronounced mid- or late-Holocene `aridification' trend at the site, an issue which is controversially debated in Italy and the Mediterranean region.

  abstract = {A high-resolution sedimentary charcoal record from Lago dell'Accesa in southern Tuscany reveals numerous changes in fire regime over the last 11.6kyrcal.BP and provides one of the longest gap-free series from Italy and the Mediterranean region. Charcoal analyses are coupled with gamma density measurements, organic-content analyses, and pollen counts to provide data about sedimentation and vegetation history. A comparison between fire frequency and lake-level reconstructions from the same site is used to address the centennial variability of fire regimes and its linkage to hydrological processes. Our data reveal strong relationships among climate, fire, vegetation, and land-use and attest to the paramount importance of fire in Mediterranean ecosystems. The mean fire interval (MFI) for the entire Holocene was estimated to be 150yr, with a minimum around 80yr and a maximum around 450yr. Between 11.6 and 3.6kyrcal.BP, up to eight high-frequency fire phases lasting 300\textendash{}500yr generally occurred during shifts towards low lake-level stands (ca 11,300, 10,700, 9500, 8700, 7600, 6200, 5300, 3400, 1800 and 1350cal.yrBP). Therefore, we assume that most of these shifts were triggered by drier climatic conditions and especially a dry summer season that promoted ignition and biomass burning. At the beginning of the Holocene, high climate seasonality favoured fire expansion in this region, as in many other ecosystems of the northern and southern hemispheres. Human impact affected fire regimes and especially fire frequencies since the Neolithic (ca 8000\textendash{}4000cal.yrBP). Burning as a consequence of anthropogenic activities became more frequent after the onset of the Bronze Age (ca 3800\textendash{}3600cal.yrBP) and appear to be synchronous with the development of settlements in the region, slash-and-burn agriculture, animal husbandry, and mineral exploitation. The anthropogenic phases with maximum fire activity corresponded to greater sensitivity of the vegetation and triggered significant changes in vegetational communities (e.g. temporal declines of Quercus ilex forests and expansion of shrublands and macchia). The link between fire and climate persisted during the mid- and late Holocene, when human impact on vegetation and the fire regime was high. This finding suggests that climatic conditions were important for fire occurrence even under strongly humanised ecosystem conditions.},
